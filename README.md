<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
Seen general situation of the society around the 3Rs practice through the time, we have realised that most people don't know how to recycle properly. This app was born in order to solve most of the doubts that even we have had when recycling, reusing o repairing products.

First release of this project is an Android app focused only on the recycling part and allows the user to scan any object with a barcode or QR in it and information of how to recycle it will be shown to the user. If the object doesn't exist user will be able to upload it just by clicking a button. Additional features are multilanguage support (English and Spanish at this moment) and the possibility to see another products uploaded by other users.

Main goal would be a social network that will encourage users to have a good 3Rs rule practice in order to reduce contamination and thus global warming. They will be able to interact with the products by sharing suggestions on how to repair/reuse them. Scanning system would be improved by deep learning recognition to not depend only on barcodes to identify a specific object.

We are aware that not everywhere is recycled the same so the final idea is also to internationalize the application and support more languages.
